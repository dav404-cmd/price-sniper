# Smart Price Sniper

Smart Price Sniper is a full-stack project that scrapes live deal data from Slickdeals, stores it in PostgreSQL, and lets users explore it through an interactive Streamlit dashboard and optional AI-powered search agents.

---

## Features

- **Fast Scraper**: Extracts product titles, prices, discounts, store names, and links using `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`.
- **Database Storage**: Saves pre-cleaned deal data into **PostgreSQL** for structured analysis.
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: Interactive UI with filtering, search, and visualizations (e.g., top stores by average discount).
- **AI Agent**: Uses LLaMA3 locally(Optional) or through openrouter api with tools:
  - *Query Searcher*: Search deals by keywords ,price or freshness in the database.
  - *Deep Scraper*: Scrape additional info like description and comments directly from deal URLs.
- **Lightweight & Modular**: Easy to extend with new data sources or features.

    git clone https://github.com/dav404-cmd/price-sniper.git
    cd price-sniper
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```

3. **Set up your environment variables:**
   - Copy the example below to `.env` and fill in your PostgreSQL credentials.
   - Example :
   ```text
   DB_NAME = your_db_name
   DB_USER = your_db_username
   DB_PASSWORD = your_db_password
   DB_HOST = your_db_host
   DB_PORT = your_db_port  
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY = your_openrouter_api(optionally,you can just use local llm)    
    ```
### Usage

#### Launch the Web App

```bash
streamlit run ui.py
```

#### Scrape Deals

- Use the "Scrape Data" tab in the UI
- Run scrapers directly:
    ```bash
    python scraper/scraper_runner_bs4.py
    ```
  - This will run a scraper with category **tech** as default.
- Customize the search 
  - You can change the type of scraping in `scraper/scraper_runner_bs4.py`
    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        run_by_search(query = "iphone",max_pages = 50)
    ```
    or 
    ```python 
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        run_by_categories(category = "tech",max_page = 50)
    ```
    to scrape by categories or search, switch the `category = ""` or `query = ""` with what you want to scrape and `max_page = `as in how many pages to scrape.
